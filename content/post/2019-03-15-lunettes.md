I started building experimental glasses after trying [the amazing 3D printed glasses by Quentin Orhant](http://cirion.tumblr.com/post/150832053041).

First, I created multiple 3D models with Blender. I thought about creating a 3D tool to generate models directly from 2D bezier curves, then I tried [Optimaker](https://www.optimaker.eu/), then I decided to create my own handcrafted 3D models.

Then I realized that I like minimalistic shapes ; so I did a first 2D test with 3mm poplar plywood sheets and the CNC of the IDLV (http://idlv.co) artist collective. The result was not perfect, I had to sand the wook after the rough CNC cut, but it was motivating.

I then made other tests with a laser-cutting machine, much faster (35 seconds !) and cleaner. I then ordered for 5 euros some spectacle lenses adapted to my eyes at the proper dimensions from my glasses, and I bought some neodyme magnets to replace the hinges. Eventually, I used a dremel to create some notches to fit the lenses.

This last step must be improved since it is not precise and a bit messy ; I could use a CNC instead.

There a plenty of room for improvement:
 
  - I could use some veneer wood - stick multiple sheets of wood together - that would enable to create a regular notch directly with the laser-cutting machine by cutting the middle layer differently,
  - Stain, paint or varnishing the wood,
  - create a small 2D glasses generator...
