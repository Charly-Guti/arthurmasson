![Tchack Poum](/images/tchack-poum.png)

[Tchack Poum](https://arthursw.github.io/tchack-poum/) (works on Google Chrome, requires [the Web MIDI API module](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-midi-api/) on Firefox) is small graphical music box experiment that I made partly from older projects.

It is very minimalistic ; I did not take time to find proper sounds and graphics, and to create an interactive grid to toggle notes and beats.

This is a draft that might, one day, evolve into something bigger...
