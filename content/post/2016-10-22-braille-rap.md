The goal of [the BrailleRap project](https://github.com/arthursw/BrailleRap/blob/master/Documentation/documentation-fr.md) is to use a 3D printer to write braille on a sheet of paper.

A software converts text into braille and gcode instructions to control the nozzle of a 3D printer to print the corresponding dots. A custom printer head was designed with OpenSCAD and 3D printed to hold the perfect pin to obtain better results.

This project took place at the [Fabrikarium](http://myhumankit.org/actualite/fabrikarium-2016-au-croisement-des-mondes/) organized by [My Human Kit](http://myhumankit.org/) at Airbus in Toulouse.
