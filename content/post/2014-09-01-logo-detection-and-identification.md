I developed a logo detection and identification system in the context of the European project FIIA, a collaboration between the french research laboratory INRIA and the Icelandic computer vision company [Videntifier](http://www.videntifier.com/). 

This project was a perfect occasion to put the computer vision theory I learned into practice. During this 18 months I enhanced my skills in OpenCV and Qt, and I coped with engineering project management.

You can read [the LDI project presentation](/presentations/fiia-retrospective.pdf) for more information.
