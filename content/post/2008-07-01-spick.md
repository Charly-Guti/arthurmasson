Spick is probably the second application which I developped in ActionScript.

The goal of this tool is to organize ideas with multiple types of hierarchy. This experiment is similar to mind-mapping apps, but at this time is was not democratized and I didn't know anything about it.

Each text box can be :
 - simple paragraphs
 - comments
 - "folders" which contains a sub-network of boxes (which can also contain other sub-boxes)
