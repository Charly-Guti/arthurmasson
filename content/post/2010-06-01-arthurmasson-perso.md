I created a [personal website](http:/arthurmasson.xyz/old/index.html) in 2010. At this time, flash was far from being abandoned, it seemed to have a great future !

I enjoyed working with ActionScript 3.0, this language is simple, powerful and somehow portable and complete. Those qualities are rarely met within a single technology. However, this language almost disappeared from the web since it requires to compile, does not give the possibility to distribute the source codes by design and does not respect web standards. I do not regret it since it was replaced by html, css and javascript for the best of the open web philosophy.
