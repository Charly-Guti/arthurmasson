OIIO (Opensource Interfaced Inputs / Outputs) is a modular interface concept which aims at establishing a communication between different artistic medias and disciplines.

This concept was developed in response to the emergence of interactive digital art. It is highly related (if not bypassed) by [Spacebrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc/), an open, dynamically re-routable software toolkit for choreographing interactive spaces.
