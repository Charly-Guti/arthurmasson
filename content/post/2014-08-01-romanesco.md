![Romanesco](/images/romanesco.png)

I always wanted to study and exploit the potential of the internet. More specifically I am interested in the way people collaborate and create together. Hence I started working on Romanesco, a collaborative drawing application based on an infinite canvas. The goal of this project is also to bring developers together to create a wide library of diverse drawing tools.
