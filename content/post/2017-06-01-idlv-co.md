The website of [Indiens Dans La Ville](http://idlv.co) is online!

![idlv.co](/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/idlv.co-home-2532x1682.png)

The minimalist CMS behind this minimalist site is ghost.js.

This node.js framework works well but it lacks of important features : media management (finding, sorting, deleting, resizing, displaying images) and internationalization / multilingual tools.

I used the theme Vapor which you can see in action on [Hipster Ghost](http://hipsterghost.com/).

I also used the [PhotoSwipe image gallery](http://photoswipe.com/), very efficient and minimalist, which require a bit of work to set up.

Because there are no tools to handle multiple languages, I had to develop a script which modifies the content of the website depending on the selected language. The content in the selected language is kept on the page while the other part is removed ; this results in a blinking of the page. To bypass this problem I added a progressive display (crossfade from white to black) in CSS and javascript.

In the end, I like this very simple website, I am glad it was worth the effort and it serves nice content.
