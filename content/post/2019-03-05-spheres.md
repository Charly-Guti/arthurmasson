[Spheres](https://arthursw.github.io/spheres/) is a set of algorithms to generate pattern to fold spheres and other geometric shapes.

Those could be used to create nice lamps from a thin layer of wook, cardboard, or from other materials.

I particularly like the orange skin and the flower foldings :
