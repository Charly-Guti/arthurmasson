      <description>I developed a logo detection and identification system in the context of the European project FIIA, a collaboration between the french research laboratory INRIA and the Icelandic computer vision company Videntifier.
This project was a perfect occasion to put the computer vision theory I learned into practice. During this 18 months I enhanced my skills in OpenCV and Qt, and I coped with engineering project management.
You can read the LDI project presentation for more information.</description>

      <description>Here is a very quick &amp;amp; dirty demo of an interactive dance app I made with OpenCV and Openframeworks. This is supposed to be used with a Kinect on a theatre or a cinema to create interactive art. This demo looks very bad, but I hope it shows the infinite possibilities one can compose with this kind of tool&amp;hellip;
I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember how to tweak every effects I implemented in this app, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t show everything, there is probably much more to experiment on stage.</description>
