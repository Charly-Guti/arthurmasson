      <description>Festival Maintenant - octobre 2017
Théâtre du Vieux St-Etienne - Rennes (Fr)
  &amp;ldquo;Does the general interest emerges from participative democracy?&amp;rdquo;
 Comme un Dessein echoes this contemporary question by inviting the public to debate and to collaboratively draw at the Maintenant festival. A collective fresco will emerge from this installation thanks to a web interface connected to a vertical plotter at the Vieux St-Etienne theatre.</description>

      <description>Gif Jokey (pronounce GJ) is a VJing app based on a gif-o-maton / a machine to build GIFs.
I was inspired by Felix Turner&amp;rsquo;s Bad TV Shader and by getmosh.io and gifpal.com.</description>

      <description>ili is a small generative algorithm which draws a pattern similar to a city map.
I largely took inspiration on the great work of J. Tarbell. I did not implement everything ; I let trails aside in order to keep something very simple and light which I like. Yet, I would like to take some time to further explore the miriads of possiblities which enables this algorithm.

This algorithm is very simple, but many methods can be used to implement it, each having pros and cons.</description>

      <description>Flou + Lent = Flan.
What becomes a sound when it is blurred?
Flan tries to answer this question by generating two things: - sharp patterns - sounds corresponding to those patterns
The link between the sounds and the patterns is simple: - triangles: sounds based on triangle waves - circles: sounds based on sine waves - rectangles: sounds based on square waves
A sound is generated for each line of the pattern.</description>

      <description>Création de : Arthur Masson &amp;amp; Gaëtan Hervé
 Musical Gears is an artwork which takes inspiration from the game of life designed by John Horton Conway in 1970.
 The game made Conway instantly famous, but it also opened up a whole new field of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata &amp;hellip; Because of Life&amp;rsquo;s analogies with the rise, fall and alterations of a society of living organisms, it belongs to a growing class of what are called &amp;ldquo;simulation games&amp;rdquo; (games that resemble real life processes).</description>

      <description>Robograff - Odyssée Urbaine 2016
Music : Funky DL &amp;amp; Nujabes - Don&amp;rsquo;t even try it
 At the Odyssée Urbaine Festival in 2016, IDLV began a project which was thought at the very beginning of the tipibot story: for the first time, the robot will use a spray paint to draw!
For this project, the collective met children at the Sonia Delaunay primary school and proposed them to draw the nature of their dream : plants, trees, flowers&amp;hellip; Children were involved in a creative process, through the dicovery of an artistic practice and the usage of digital technologies.</description>

      <description>Ondes portées is an interactive installation which emerges the public in a interactive vector field made of wavy images and sounds.
People&amp;rsquo;s motion acts on the sonor and visual universe, the artwork invites to experiment moves to influence the final composition.</description>

      <description>Les murs ont des yeux tracks, stares, fixes, oppresses, inspects, controls the visitor, and questions the la banalization of digital surveillance and how we face it.
This installation is composed of a camera (2D or Kinect) placed under a projection screen, and connected to a tracking software which controls the eye grid in the direction of the visitor.

      <description>Here is a very quick &amp;amp; dirty demo of an interactive dance app I made with OpenCV and Openframeworks. This is supposed to be used with a Kinect on a theatre or a cinema to create interactive art. This demo looks very bad, but I hope it shows the infinite possibilities one can compose with this kind of tool&amp;hellip;
I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember how to tweak every effects I implemented in this app, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t show everything, there is probably much more to experiment on stage.</description>

      <description>Fantasmagorie is composed of 8 columns disposed in such way that one can move inside. The spectator placed in the center of the installation can manipulate images and sounds all around him by moving. The image penetrates 6 vertical and horizontal layers on which visuals and sounds criss-corss so that the spectator dives into an immersive world.
I developing my knownledge about shaders thanks to this artwork.</description>

      <description>OIIO (Opensource Interfaced Inputs / Outputs) is a modular interface concept which aims at establishing a communication between different artistic medias and disciplines.
This concept was developed in response to the emergence of interactive digital art. It is highly related (if not bypassed) by Spacebrew, an open, dynamically re-routable software toolkit for choreographing interactive spaces.

      <description>My Tailer is Rich
 This installation is a complete programming interface for a light fresco. I made it with Quartz Composer so that other artists could easily modify the software.
In the end, the software was so complex that it is far from easy to understand it, so this technological choice was probably not the best, but it was a fun technical challenge.
I am pretty happy of the result which we presented at the Pim&amp;rsquo;s, a night club in which I would have never gone otherwise.</description>

      <description>I enhanced my video processing skills with the artistic installation &amp;ldquo;Tranche de vie&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; (built with OpenCV). I developed this project with openframeworks for a large LED screen.
One of the goal of the installation was to use the special format of the screen which was composed of 5 large vertical stripes.</description>

      <description>The Show&amp;rsquo;Box is a karaoke shower box. The idea is simple : one can sing confortably feeling alone under the shower, while being filmed and screened in the large room with the audience! Everything to exhibit in intimacy :-)
I developed the software which enable to select and play a video with subtitles, to overlay the singers on top of it, and to choose patterns for the background. Built with C++ and openframeworks.</description>

      <description>La Sophiste was in charge of VJing for the trance music festival Wisdom.
This was my first video mapping / VJing installation, it required a good amound of work but was worth the effort. Being a VJ for a crowd of thousands of people is fun, and we were really satistied by our work, although everything did not work exactly as expected.
I created an entire VJing app with Quartz Composer which was monitored via midi mapped controlers.</description>

      <description>This sound generator was one of my very first application. It is very simple, but can theoretically simulate any sound since it is possible to add an &amp;ldquo;infinite&amp;rdquo; amount of sine waves :-)</description>
