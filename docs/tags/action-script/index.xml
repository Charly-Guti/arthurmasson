      <description>My second year project at ESIR was a logical circuit simulator.
I developed a dynamic version which show of logical signals propagate in the circuits.
The work area is small, but it is possible to navigate on the canvas to create complexe circuits.
I could then build this 4 bits adder :</description>

      <description>I created a personal website in 2010. At this time, flash was far from being abandoned, it seemed to have a great future !
I enjoyed working with ActionScript 3.0, this language is simple, powerful and somehow portable and complete. Those qualities are rarely met within a single technology. However, this language almost disappeared from the web since it requires to compile, does not give the possibility to distribute the source codes by design and does not respect web standards.</description>

      <description>I created an e-commerce website with a flash version and a Joomla / Virtuemart version in 2009.
This job required me to develop different skills : graphic designer, web developer, UX designer etc. This project was intense, very interesting and rewarding :-)</description>

      <description>For my first year at engineering school, I had fun working on a flash presentation about graphic design for my english course, and this is the result. As you can see, I was not a graphic designer, but I do like graphic design.</description>

      <description>Spick is probably the second application which I developped in ActionScript.
The goal of this tool is to organize ideas with multiple types of hierarchy. This experiment is similar to mind-mapping apps, but at this time is was not democratized and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about it.
Each text box can be : - simple paragraphs - comments - &amp;ldquo;folders&amp;rdquo; which contains a sub-network of boxes (which can also contain other sub-boxes)</description>

      <guid>http://arthurmasson.xyz/sound-generator/</guid>
      <description>This sound generator was one of my very first application. It is very simple, but can theoretically simulate any sound since it is possible to add an &amp;ldquo;infinite&amp;rdquo; amount of sine waves :-)</description>
